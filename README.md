You're given a small app that fetches images from Flickr (http://www.flickr.com) and displays them in a grid. 

The app has a small problem where sometimes the images don't show up or the user has to tap on the display first before the images show up. 



You have the following tasks: 


1. Fix this bug

2. Since the source code doesn't contain any data model objects, you need to introdude them.

3. Write unit tests for the data models. 

4. Implement a feature, where clicking on a thumbnail opens the image in a full screen view and shows the image name



Clone the repository and send us link to the project when you're done.
